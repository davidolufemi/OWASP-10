STRIDE Analysis for Document Management System (DMS)
The STRIDE model is a threat modeling methodology that helps identify potential threats to a system. STRIDE stands for:

Spoofing
Tampering
Repudiation
Information Disclosure
Denial of Service (DoS)
Elevation of Privilege (EoP)
We'll now analyze potential threats for each of the components of the Document Management System (DMS) in the context of STRIDE and outline the mitigations for each one.

1. Trusted Zone: Web Frontend (Client)
Web Frontend is where users interact with the DMS, including authentication, document uploads, document previews, and search functionalities.

Threats and Mitigations
Spoofing:

Threat: An attacker impersonates a legitimate user or admin by guessing or stealing credentials.
Mitigation:
Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
Use session management techniques to prevent session hijacking.
Apply anti-phishing measures (e.g., email validation) to avoid fake login pages.
Tampering:

Threat: An attacker modifies data in transit between the user and the server, such as altering uploaded documents or changing search query parameters.
Mitigation:
Use TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS) to ensure data integrity during transmission.
Validate all user inputs (e.g., form fields, file uploads) on both the client and server sides.
Implement content security policies (CSP) to prevent script injection or data tampering via JavaScript.
Repudiation:

Threat: A user denies performing actions like uploading or deleting documents.
Mitigation:
Implement audit logging that tracks user actions (e.g., document uploads, modifications, and deletions).
Ensure logs are tamper-evident (e.g., immutable logs).
Require users to provide detailed descriptions when performing actions like document deletions.
Information Disclosure:

Threat: Sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized users, such as displaying private documents in search results.
Mitigation:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure principle of least privilege.
Encrypt sensitive data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
Apply access control checks for each resource (document) when performing operations such as searching, previewing, and downloading.
Prevent file directory traversal attacks by sanitizing file paths.
Denial of Service (DoS):

Threat: An attacker floods the system with excessive requests, causing it to become unavailable for legitimate users (e.g., by overloading the upload or search functionality).
Mitigation:
Implement rate limiting for uploads and search requests.
Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to block malicious traffic.
Use load balancing and auto-scaling to handle high traffic.
Enable DDoS protection services (e.g., Cloudflare or AWS Shield).
Elevation of Privilege (EoP):

Threat: A user can escalate their privileges to perform unauthorized actions (e.g., an attacker elevates themselves to admin).
Mitigation:
Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) and validate user roles before allowing sensitive actions.
Regularly audit user permissions and roles.
Use secure session management and enforce session expiration after inactivity.
Ensure secure login mechanisms with features like CAPTCHA or login throttling to prevent brute force attacks.


2. Trusted Zone: Backend Server
The Backend Server handles business logic, processes file uploads, file sharing, and interacts with the database to retrieve and store document metadata.

Threats and Mitigations
Spoofing:

Threat: An attacker impersonates the backend server to perform unauthorized actions or retrieve sensitive data.
Mitigation:
Use secure API keys and authentication tokens to authenticate between components.
Implement mutual TLS to ensure both client and server authenticate each other.
Ensure the backend server verifies the integrity of incoming requests (e.g., using HMAC or JWT tokens).
Tampering:

Threat: An attacker modifies requests or responses from the backend (e.g., altering document metadata or document content).
Mitigation:
Use end-to-end encryption (TLS/SSL) to prevent tampering in transit.
Implement data validation and sanitization at the server side to detect and block malicious data.
Ensure input validation for APIs to prevent manipulation of sensitive data.
Repudiation:

Threat: Users deny performing actions like sharing or modifying documents.
Mitigation:
Log all user actions (e.g., document uploads, changes) with associated timestamps.
Implement digital signatures for document transactions to prove action authenticity.
Store logs in a tamper-resistant manner, ensuring they cannot be modified by users or attackers.
Information Disclosure:

Threat: Attackers gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database or transmitted by the server.
Mitigation:
Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., documents, metadata) using strong encryption algorithms.
Ensure database access controls are properly configured, applying RBAC for data access.
Limit sensitive data exposure in logs or error messages.
Denial of Service (DoS):

Threat: An attacker overwhelms the backend server with excessive requests, causing delays or downtime.
Mitigation:
Implement rate limiting and API throttling to restrict the number of requests from a single user or IP.
Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.
Enable auto-scaling for the backend infrastructure to handle increased traffic.
Elevation of Privilege (EoP):

Threat: A low-privileged user gains unauthorized administrative access through an exploit.
Mitigation:
Implement strict access controls on backend services to prevent unauthorized users from accessing administrative endpoints.
Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) in backend services, ensuring that users have the least privileges necessary for their role.
Monitor user behavior for any signs of privilege escalation (e.g., changes in role or access patterns).
3. Trusted Zone: Database
The Database stores documents, user credentials, metadata, and access permissions.

Threats and Mitigations
Spoofing:

Threat: An attacker impersonates an authorized user to gain access to documents or modify data.
Mitigation:
Use secure authentication methods (e.g., SQL injection prevention, authentication tokens, or multi-factor authentication).
Ensure database credentials are stored securely (e.g., in an encrypted vault, not in code).
Tampering:

Threat: Attackers manipulate document data or metadata stored in the database.
Mitigation:
Use database-level encryption for sensitive data at rest.
Implement integrity checks (e.g., hashes or digital signatures) to validate the integrity of documents and metadata.
Use audit logging to track changes in document records.
Repudiation:

Threat: A user denies performing database operations like modifying or deleting documents.
Mitigation:
Enable database auditing to track changes to sensitive data and user activity.
Store logs in a tamper-proof manner and require secure credentials to access log data.
Information Disclosure:

Threat: Unauthorized users access sensitive data stored in the database, such as document contents or user details.
Mitigation:
Implement data encryption for both in-transit and at-rest data.
Use role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure users can only access data they are authorized to.
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Denial of Service (DoS):

Threat: Attackers perform queries that overwhelm the database, causing it to slow down or crash.
Mitigation:
Implement query optimization and rate limiting for database operations.
Use replication to ensure high availability and load balancing across database servers.
Implement database connection pooling to handle bursts of traffic without overloading the database.
Elevation of Privilege (EoP):

Threat: A user escalates their database access privileges to gain unauthorized control over the data.
Mitigation:
Ensure RBAC policies are enforced at the database level.
Regularly audit user permissions and roles to ensure correct privilege assignments.
Use least privilege principles to limit database access to the minimum necessary permissions.
